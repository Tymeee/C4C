# Overview
A take-home project for Code4Community's developer position.

The program is a public message board that mimics the interface of a chat app. Users must aunthenticate themselves with their Google account to use the program.

## Component Explanation
Front-end: ReactJS | Back-end: Firebase

The program consists of five main components:
- App - checks whether the user is signed in to use the message board
- MessageBoard - displays all the messages sent along with the sender's information and the timestamps 
- MessageBoardInput - consist of the input form form, text count, and submit button to send the message to the message board
- SignIn - opens a pop up for users to sign in with their Gmail account
- SignOut - sign out button

The program utilizes Firebase Firestore as the backend with messages store in the following document fields:
- createdAt (time-stamp)
- photoURL (profile pic)
- text (input message)
- uid (account id)
  
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
